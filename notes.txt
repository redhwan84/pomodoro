THE THREE LAYERS:

    DATA LAYER: The core thing that is dealt with/manipulated. In this case it is the TASK.
        - What info does this TASK need?
        - What behavior should it follow?
    
    LOGIC LAYER: What to do with the data and how? In this case it is the four functions in main.

    UI/INTERACTION LAYER: How does user interact with the program. In this case it is the user through
    the terminal via a while loop where the user chooses which to do.
